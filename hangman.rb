#When a new game is started, load in the dictionary and randomly select a word between 5 and 12 characters long for the secret word

#Display a counter so the player knows how many more incorrect guesses they have before the game ends

#Display which correct letters have already been chosen (and their position in the word, e.g. _ r o g r a _ _ i n g) and which incorrect letters have already been chosen

#Every turn, allow the player to make a guess of a letter (it should be case insensitive)

#Update the display to reflect whether the letter was correct or incorrect
#If out of guesses, the player should lose

#AFTER DEVELOPING THE GAME

#Instead of making a guess, the player should also have the option to save the game

#When the program first loads, allow the player to open one of their saved games, which jumps exactly back to the saved moment
